# How to Teach Programming

Notes from **How to Teach Programming (And Other Things)** by Greg Wilson

### Preparation

Pause for a moment to think about the most influential teacher you've had. What made them different? What was it about their class or style that impacted you so much? 

## Who are your learners?

Stages of cognitive development: 

1. **Novice:** Someone who doesn't know what they don't know
2. **Competent Practitioner:** Able to handle normal tasks with normal effort under normal conditions
3. **Expert:** Able to easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary

One challenge in building a mental model for novices is to clear away things that *don't* belong.

## Assessments

#### Formative Assessments

Takes place during a lesson while an instructor is teaching. Tells the instructor and learner how the learner is doing and allows the instructor to shape the lesson and what to focus on next.

A good formative assessment requires people to think through a problem.

#### Summative Assessments

Takes place at the end of the lesson to tell whether the desired learning took place and whether the learner is ready to move on.

> When the cook tastes the soup, that's formative. When the guests taste the soup, that's summative.
